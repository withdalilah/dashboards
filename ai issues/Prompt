As a UI/UX Designer, design a clean, intuitive, and interactive analytics dashboard using the provided Google Sheet data from the tab named "November". Provide me a complete Google Apps Script web app with the following characteristics:

GLOBAL DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS

1. Add a filter bar at the top with options for:All data
Each individual month (based on Column AH, date format dd/mm/yyyy; extract the month for filtering)
All dashboard sections, cards, and charts must dynamically update based on the selected filter.

2. KEY METRIC CARDS
Create four key metric cards showing the total number of tickets with a rating of 1 star or less for:Dubai
Portugal
UK
GR (sum of all 1-star or lower tickets across all markets)

Each card should be clickable. When clicked, display a pop-up with a detailed list including:Issue ID (Column A)
Issue Status (Column E)
Property ID (Column M)
Office (Column P)
Issue Category (Column AF)
Subcategory (Column AG)

3. CHARTS SECTION
Each chart must include a market filter: All markets, Dubai, Portugal, UK.

Chart 1: Timeline Chart (Ticket Volume Over Time)
Show the number of Issue IDs (Column A) over time for each market, using Column AH (extract month from dd/mm/yyyy).
When a data point is clicked, display the total Issue IDs from all markets for that date range in a pop-up with the detailed list above.

Chart 2: Donut Chart (Ticket Status Distribution)
Show the proportion of each ticket status (Column E).

Chart 3: Horizontal Bar Chart (Cases by Category)

Pie slices should be clickable to display the detailed list above in a pop-up.

Chart 6: Horizontal Bar Chart (Top Repeated Property IDs)
Show the top 5 property IDs with the most repeated tickets rated ≤ 1 star.
If "All" is selected, show the top 5 repeated properties across all markets, grouped by market.
If a specific market is selected, show the top 5 repeated properties within that market, sorted descending.

4. SPECIAL ANALYSIS SECTION

Count all tickets where:
Column AD = "Global GXO - Reviews Post-mortem"
